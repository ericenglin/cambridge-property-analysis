<p>Created by Eric Englin</p>

<p>This analysis looks into the property dataset on Cambridge Open Data portal. The maps created and analysis were used for Harvard Graduate School of Design's Land Use Law Zoning Code Exercise where we are meant to analyze an existing zoning code and propose beneficial changes. My paper is about the eligible lots for ADUs and how criteria can be relaxed to encourage development. </p>

<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>

<p>The objective for this analysis is to look into lot parcels in Cambridge, MA where accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are possible. Due to changing regulations in the city zoning code, these eligible lots have fluctuated over time, but the main factors are the area of the lot and the interior area of the house/dwelling unit.
Data from Cambridge Open Data Portal at <a href = "https://data.cambridgema.gov/Assessing/Cambridge-Property-Database-FY16-FY20/eey2-rv59"> this location </a>.</p>
